# neovim-flake

Forked from [jordanisaacs](https://github.com/jordanisaacs/neovim-flake)
My chages will not be much and they'll be pretty focused on my preference and needs.
Please consider using the original repo instead. It'll be better suited for you, probably.

```
nix run github:CloudyChris/neovim-flake
